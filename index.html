    <title> DNA message </title>
    Dif tor heh smusma ! You probably know that data storage is a big challenge in our century. </br>
    According to Marc Antonini The Digital Universe, the amount of data stored on the planet-will reach 175 zettabytes by 2025 (One zettabyte is equivalent to one thousand billion billion bytes, or one billion terabyte hard disks). </br>
    One of the "in progress" solution is to encode cold data in DNA. The stability of DNA could allow us to retrieve data thousands years later (if kept away form light, water and oxigen) and with a density of 450 million To2 per gram of DNA, all the world's data could fit into the volume of a chocolate bar. </br>

    Anyway, I use a simpliest way to encode you a message in this sequence which will allow you to get the answer 2 </br>
Long live and prosper. </br>
